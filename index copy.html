                <td>French Film black and white film on police brutality. Things to notice are the shots when they are in the tunnel (produces a stark contrast between chacaters and the environment with a good use of lighting.) Great cinematography and camera techniques used with mirrors (in the room and bathroom) and great shot with tv behind character as he 'boxes' towards the end of the movie. Unexpected Ending.</td>
